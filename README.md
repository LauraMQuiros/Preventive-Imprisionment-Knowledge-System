# Preventive-Imprisionment-Knowledge-System
For the subject Knowledge Technology Practical, we are creating a knowledge system that determines whether someone will go to preventive prison for the time being before the trial. 
There are two main reasons for someone to be sent to preventive prison: either they are considered a danger to society or there is an increased risk of fleeing. 
This knowledge system evaluates both factors through the summation and multiplication of several weights (of crimes and modifiers) and coefficients. 
This allows to compute the likelihood of a person to go to preventive prison in the spanish justice system according to antecedents, crime commited and ease of posterior location.
